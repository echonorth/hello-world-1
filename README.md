# First Git Practice Submission
This is the readme file for your first assignment submission. You will learn to upload your assignments through this practice. Read the instructions carefully.

1. Clone this repository onto your chosen IDE, do not complete this through Github.com (repl, VS Code, or none with GitHub Desktop)
2. Go to the main.py file and fix all the grammar and spelling errors in the file on your chosen IDE.
3. Once completed, save the file.
4. Stage and commit the changes.
5. Push the changes.
6. Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and into your classroom organization. Check to see if you can find your repository fully updated with the changes you made earlier.

This will be the procedure you will follow to upload assignments and practices into GitHub.
